# üìÅ Projects

## 1. context
Demonstrates how to manage and utilize context within agents to maintain state across interactions.

## 2. handoffs
Shows how to implement handoff mechanisms, allowing agents to transfer control to other systems or human operators.

## 3. input-guardrail
Illustrates the use of input validation and guardrails to ensure that inputs to tools and agents are safe and conform to expected formats.

## 4. multi-llm-chainlit
Integrates multiple LLMs (Large Language Models) in a Chainlit framework to create complex agent workflows.

## 5. output-guardrail
Focuses on implementing output validation and guardrails to ensure that the responses generated by agents are appropriate and safe.

## 6. run-hook-agent-hook
Demonstrates the use of hooks to extend and customize the agent's behavior during execution.

## 7. run-sync
Provides examples of running agents synchronously, suitable for applications where real-time responses are critical.

## 8. streaming
Showcases how to implement streaming capabilities in agents, enabling real-time data processing and interaction.

## 9. structure
Explores the structuring of agent workflows and data handling to build scalable and maintainable systems.

## 10. tool
Demonstrates how to integrate and utilize external tools within agents to extend their functionality.
